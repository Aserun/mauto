mauto - as in Maya Automation
=============================
`mauto` is a generic macro tool for Autodesk Maya.

`mauto` implements a simple (but efficient) static analysis algorithm
which solves the external and internal dependencies at runtime, 
giving you te ability to automate repetitive tasks without write a single
line of code.


## Dependencies

- [PySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide)
- [Nose](http://nose.readthedocs.org) + [Mock](http://mock.readthedocs.org) (testing)

> `mauto` has been tested on Maya 2014+ but it should run in older
versions, please let me know if you find any issues.


## Installation

Copy the `mauto` directory somewhere in your `PYTHONPATH` (maya scripts
directory should do the trick) or clone the repo and install the project
through its `setup.py` script (_highly recommended!_).

    mayapy setup.py install

## Ussage

    import mauto
    
    #  Launch the Maya GUI...
    mauto.show()

    # ... or use it through the python api.

    # list existing macros
    mauto.list_macros()

    # load and execute a macro from the library
    m = mauto.get_macro("my_macro")
    m.play()
    
    # redefine inputs
    m = mauto.get_macro("my_macro")
    refs = m.inputs #  dict of ext references
    refs["locator1"] = "pCube"
    m.play(refs)

    # create a new macro
    m = mauto.new_macro("my_macro")
    m.record()
    m.stop()
    mauto.save_macro("my_macro")

    # create a new macro from a log str
    m = mauto.new_macro("my_macro", log)
